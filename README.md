# How-to-html-and-css

## For Students
You have been send to this repository, that must mean you have been building a big part of your own website already! 
Have look around, compare this code to your own and create an opinion on what you like and what you would do differently.


## For Teachers
### Lesson Plan:

#### Opening Hook for Learning *(How will I gain students' attention?)* (15 MIN)

  * Assignment for students: Gather everything you know about HTML, CSS and Clean Coding. Work in groups of two or three, and write the answer to the following questions on the whiteboard:
    
    * What do you know about the subjects?
    * What can HTML do? What can't it do?
    * What can CSS do? What can't it do?
    * What is important about writing clean code?
    * What are examples of clean code?
    * DO you know any helpful websites when you are writing HTML/CSS?
  
  * Assignment for teacher: Structure the words on the whiteboard: ask students to explain what questions their answers belong to and elaborate on what they have written. (Warn for websites with mistakes, stack overflow)
  
  #### Direct Instruction *(How will I present new material and make learning relevant?)* (15 MIN)
  
  * HTML and CSS = what user sees in browser. All frontend is based upon these languages.
  * Clean Code = what makes your code readable, how you can colaborate, grow, looks professional
  * You will build a website: 'How To HTML & CSS'.
  
    * Working in groups of three
    * We will mimic the working environment, where you just have to figure things out yourself
    * We do that because you all should have the knowledge from the preparatory work, and everything is googable
    * We will help you with the structure - see readest
    
  * This are learning goals (show page reader), most important:
  
    * Basic structure of html/css
    * How to set up/finish a project
    * Working together (tools, writing clean code)
    * Reading (assignment, later errors)
    
  * Follow the readest, we help with structure: Set up, advise, Plan, Content (HTML), Refactor/Lunch (Important), Styling, Deployment, Demo.
  * Review at 4pm
  * 4.45pm Demos and presentation of subjects (by students!)
  * if you need HELP?!?! - Google and ask your class mates first!
  
  #### Guided and Independent Practice
  * 11:00 Students start on their website
  * 11:20 Remind them it is time to start on HTML
  * 12:30 Remind them about lunch time! - Check whether they feel they are on schedule
  * 13:30 After lunch give them html from this repository, so they can start refactoring
  * 14:30 Remind them it is time to work on CSS
  * 16:00 Deploy, prepare presentation
  * 16:30 Demos + presentations
  * 17:15 Peer review (see evaluation exercise) + class evaluation (see questions)
  
  #### Closing *(How can I bring closure to summarize learning and enhance retention of the material?)*
  * Discuss questions peer review
  * Ask groups, what went really well?
  * What was the most difficult part?
  * What did you see at another group that you really liked?
  * How did you keep your code DRY and KISS?
